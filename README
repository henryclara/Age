This code simulates an ice rise with stratigraphy.

Current simulations:

- TestPS15Layers
- TestPS20Layers
- TestPS25Layers
- TestPS30Layers
- TestPSAddExportedVariables
- TestPSAgeSolver

Notes:

24.03.22

ParStokes currently working without an age solver (simulations with parstokes and the age solver are currently running, however). Simulations need to have reached the forward simulation before checking whether the age solver has worked.

25.03.22

Simulations currently downloading. Assessment will be made after viewing vtus in paraview. Note: none of these sims are running.

TestPS15Layers:
TestPS20Layers: crashed in forward simulation
TestPS25Layers:
TestPS30Layers:
TestPSAddExportedVariables:
TestPSAgeSolver:

Simulations started:

BedInit650Layers30
BedInit700Layers30
BedInit750Layers30

(These simulations are for checking the lowest bedrock with which an ice rise forms, all running at 11:30)

HigherFriction: One set of time steps has been run with the age initial condition, now restarted with the age initial condition turned off.

BedInit*: Init restarted with just one short timestep, i.e. 1, 1, 0.1

28.03.22

BedInit650Layers30 at 50 years: looks likely to be stable. ParStokes converging nicely
BedInit700Layers30 at 75 years: looks likely to be stable (close to threshold point, however). ParStokes not converging nicely. Will this alleviate itself as the system evolves?
BedInit750Layers30 at 100 years: has switched from an ice rise to an ice rumple. ParStokes not converging
